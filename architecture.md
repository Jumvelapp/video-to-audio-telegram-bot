## Data Flow

1. User sends a video link to the Telegram bot
2. Bot validates user permissions and sends request to Conversion Service
3. Conversion Service downloads video, extracts audio, and returns audio file
4. Bot delivers audio file back to the user

## Scaling Considerations

- Each service can be scaled independently based on load
- Conversion Service can be horizontally scaled to handle multiple conversions
- Queue system ensures fair resource allocation based on subscription tier

## Security Measures

- All services communicate over encrypted channels
- User authentication uses industry-standard protocols
- Payment information is handled securely through Stripe
- No permanent storage of video or audio files

## Deployment Strategy

- Services are containerized using Docker
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
- Separate environments for development, testing, and production
